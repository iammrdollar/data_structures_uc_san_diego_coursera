## GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

```

The greatest common divisor GCD(a,b) of two non-negative integers a and b (which are not both equal to 0) is the greatest integer d that divides both a and b.

-----

PROBLEM: Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

INPUT: The two integers a, b are given in the same line separated by space.

CONSTRAINTS. 0 <= a, b <= 2*10^9

OUTPUT: Output GCD(a, b)

------

SAMPLE

Input: 18 35
Output: 1

Input: 28851538 1183019
Output: 17657

-----

EXPLANATION

GCD(18, 35) = 1
18 and 35 do not have common non-trivial divisors.

GCD(28851538, 1183019) = 17657
28851538 = 17657*1634 and 1183019 = 17657*67
