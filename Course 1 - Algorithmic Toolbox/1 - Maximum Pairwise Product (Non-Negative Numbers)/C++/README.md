```

Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.

Input: A sequence of non-negative integers.

Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.

### Naive Method

 - Go through the elements in two nested loops and find maximum product.

### Fast Method (2n Complexity)

 - Go through the elements in two separate loops and find two max elements with different indexes.
