## LCM (Least Common Multiple)

```

The least common multiple of two positive integers a and b is the least 
positive integer m that is divisible by both a and b.

-----

PROBLEM: Given two integers a and b, find their least common multiple.

INPUT: The two integers a and b are given in the same line separated by space.

CONSTRAINTS. 0 <= a, b <= 2*10^9

OUTPUT: Output LCM(a, b)

------

SAMPLE

Input: 6 8
Output: 24

Input: 28851538 1183019
Output: 1933053046

-----

EXPLANATION

LCM(6, 8) = 24
Among all the positive integers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 
(e.g., 48, 480, 24), 24 is the smallest one.

LCM(28851538, 1183019) = 1933053046
1933053046 is the smallest positive integer divisible by both 28851538 and 1183019.
